                            KSBL students visited a plastics factory, Syntech Fibres where they saw the process of recycling plastics as well as the making of various products. Students were exposed to raw material, polypropylene, which can be converted into diverse products including yarns, filters, and rope. Upstream changes to increase sustainability would require an alternative for polypropene. The students discussed possible natural alternatives such as cotton, which are not refined enough to perform the same tasks as PP.

                            Students learned how one pair of jeans requires 10,000 liters of water, therefore, reinforcing the aspect of life cycle analysis which is a scientific method of comparing the sustainability of materials and products. Participants were encouraged to consider unconventional means of finance and information dissemination, such as crowdsourcing, to increase environmental action. This was done by informing them about setting up air quality monitors to gather data on air quality in the country. This data-fed information led to the local production of KN[1]95 masks required to protect oneself from air pollution.
