                           <p>Dr. Javaid firmly believes that technology is an imperative determinant of economic growth; whereas technological change takes place in the framework of a complex process of institutional embeddedness, in which policies and institutions co-evolve with the macroeconomic environments. Therefore, he contends that differences among financial institutions and financial sector policies within the framework of "national system of innovation" have strong potential to explain the nature and causes of the differences of the wealth of nations. Following this context his research and teaching interests revolve around Financial System, Macroeconomics, Business Government Relations, Innovation & Technological Change, Industrial Organization and Corporate Strategy. Dr. Javaid has presented his research work at several International peer reviewed conferences.</p>
