                                areas: Gene and Nucleic Acid Based Therapies, New Horizons in Pharmacology and Regenerative 
                                Medicine. Fouzia also implements the authentic assessments for that course. As a lead for the 
                                Coordinated Transformation Group, Fouzia plays a key role in the transformation of the MSc 
                                programme to blended/remote delivery. She is a project supervisor and a module leader for the
