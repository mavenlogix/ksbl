                    <h2>Karachi Education Initiative (KEI)</h2>
                    <p>The Karachi Education Initiative (KEI) is a not-for-profit entity registered under Section 42 of the Companies Ordinance. The KEI is the sponsoring and fundraising entity of KSBL. Sponsor Directors, representing some of the leading industrial and financial groups in Pakistan, have pledged a contribution of at least Rs.100 million (USD 1.2 million) on behalf of their respective organizations to provide the core funding for the KSBL. They have also committed to raising a permanent endowment to facilitate the education of meritorious students at KSBL, as well as for the provision of resources, facilities and buildings required to create a world-class institution.</p>
                    <p>The KEI's vision has moved from idea to reality at a remarkable pace. It initially consulted with the Global Business School Network (GBSN), an international network of top-ranked business schools based in Washington DC. An International Advisory Board (IAB) was formed, composed of academic luminaries from fourteen leading business schools worldwide. With the guidance of IAB a Strategic Plan for the KSBL was developed.</p>
                    <p>The KEI then established a partnership with the Judge Business School (JBS), University of Cambridge and a Strategic Collaboration Agreement was signed in April 2009.</p>
                    <p>The quest undertaken by KSBL is to bring a value-added and holistic business education degree program. Our academic system is structured to facilitate young talent with a globally-recognized curriculum to reform them into world leaders who can amend conventional ways of leading.</p>
