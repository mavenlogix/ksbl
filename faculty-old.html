						<div class="hover-detail">
							<span class="orange-yellow-text">Dr. Nadeem Javaid</span> holds a PhD in Economics and MS in Innovation and Industrial Dynamics from the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, France. Dr. Javaid has over 20 years of experience in academia, financial industry and policymaking. From August 2014 to October 2018, he has the privilege to be the Chief Economist of Government of Pakistan with the responsibility to advise the highest decision making forums such as Central Development Working Party (CDWP), Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC), National Economic Council (NEC) and Federal Cabinet.

The rigorous CPEC negotiations between China and Pakistan spanned over two-year period.  The result is an approved document delineating the aspirational goals of both nations and a framework of cooperation worth $60 Billion of Projects under Chinese flagship Belt and Road Initiative.<br/><br/>

Also, Dr. Javaid served as an ex-officio Member of Economic Policy & Planning at the Planning Commission chaired by Prime Minister of Pakistan. He also served as Member Policy Board of Accountant General of Pakistan Revenue, Member National Accounts Committee and Member BoG CPEC Center of Excellence at PIDE University, Islamabad.  In addition, he contributed as a member of the Working Group on Regulatory Reforms at the Economic Reforms Unit, Ministry of Finance.<br/><br/>

His PhD dissertation highlights the role of the financial sector in driving successful technological change in an economic system.<br/><br/>

<span class="orange-yellow-text">Research & Teaching Interests</span><br/>
Dr. Javaid firmly believes that technology is an imperative determinant of economic growth; whereas technological change takes place in the framework of a complex process of institutional embeddedness, in which policies and institutions co-evolve with the macroeconomic environments. Therefore, he contends that differences among financial institutions and financial sector policies within the framework of "national system of innovation" have strong potential to explain the nature and causes of the differences of the wealth of nations. Following this context his research and teaching interests revolve around Financial System, Macroeconomics, Business Government Relations, Innovation & Technological Change, Industrial Organization and Corporate Strategy.<br/><br/>
Dr. Javaid has presented his research work at several International peer reviewed conferences including 13th Schumpeter Society Conference (Aalborg, Denmark), 8th GLOBELICS Conference (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), 6th GLOBELICS Conference (Mexico City), 3rd Thematic Meeting of the French Economic Association (Sophia Antipolis, France) and 5th GLOBELICS Academy on Innovation and Development (Tempere, Finland).<br/><br/>
